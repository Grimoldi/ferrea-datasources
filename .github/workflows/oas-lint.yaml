  # OpenApi definition automatic update and validation.
  Create a bundle file (using a redocly), than proceed to validate it against linting.
  The bundle file will then be used from the web server.
  In case of creation/update of the bundle file, autocommit it.

  Run only if anything has been changed under the definitions or on this file itself.
